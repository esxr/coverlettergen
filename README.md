# Coverlettergen : Personalized Cover Letter API

### Intro
**Coverlettergen** is an API for crafting tailored cover letters by understanding your **resume** and the **job description** you're aiming for. Say goodbye to generic cover letters and let **Coverlettergen** make your application stand out!

### Installation and Quickstart
1. Before diving in, ensure you peek into the `.env.example` file. Create a corresponding `.env` file with your configurations.
2. Then get the entire project up and running with a simple

```
docker-compose up --build
```

### API
The server has the following API endpoints:

##### `POST /generate_cover_letter`
```
{
    "resume": "sample resume",
    "job_description": "sample job description",
    "extra_information": "sample extra information",
    "to": "john.doe@email.com"
}
```
returns
```
{
    "task_id": "2982028d-6883-4acc-a34a-fd9661a536a8"
}
```

##### `GET /generate_cover_letter/<task_id>/status`
returns
```
{
    "task_status": "<PENDING | FAILURE | SUCCESS>"
}
```

##### `GET /generate_cover_letter/<task_id>/result`
returns
```
<html>
...
<EMAIL BODY IN HTML FORMAT HERE>
...
</html>
```

### Deployment
ðŸš§ **Under Construction**: The deployment section is currently in the works and is experimental. However, I'm excited to share that Coverlettergen will be fully deployable on AWS right out-of-the-box using Terraform! After your successful deployment, locate the server URL in the `api.txt` file.
